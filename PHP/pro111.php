        Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
        
        PHP Conditional Statements
        Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions. You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

        In PHP we have the following conditional statements:

        
        if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
        if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
        if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions
        switch statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed

        PHP - The if Statement

        The if statement executes some code if one condition is true.
    */


        /*  if(condition){
            executable code when condition is true
        }*/

        if(10 > 5){
            echo "<hr>Welcome to world of Conditions in PHP";
        }
        echo "<hr> Program Completed";
    ?>
